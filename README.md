# Git aliases

This is a collection of aliases that I like to use to optimize my git usage a
little. I mostly use command line Git, so this makes my life a lot easier.


# Setup
I recommend you do not copy these directly into your .gitconfig, though you
could! Instead, I recommend cloning this repository somewhere and adding it to
your git by "include" [as described
here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557183/is-it-possible-to-include-a-file-in-your-gitconfig)
